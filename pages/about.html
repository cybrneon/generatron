        <h3>WHAT IS A GEOMETRY?</h3>
          <p>In our world, most objects are three-dimensional. A point, a line, a plane, a sphere, and so on. But what about higher-dimensional objects? In our world, there are three dimensions of length, width, and height.
          <br> What happens if we add a fourth dimension? Well, there’s a dimension of time. The one thing that we don’t have is a dimension of color.
          <br> How do we know that there are only three dimensions of length, width, and height? Well, if we imagine a cube, that’s a perfect three-dimensional object.</p>
