# Generatron
#### Version 2.0 - "WHISTLER"

## Introduction
When I started this project during a creative coding course in my second year of the Visual Communication Bachelor at [HEAD-GenÃ¨ve](https://www.hesge.ch/head/), I wanted it to be bigger than what I achieved at that moment.

Exploring [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and diving a bit more in web technologies was really fun. Teachers and people were so enthusiastic to see the project develop and I had big dreams for it.

**The idea of mixing music and live visuals isn't new.** Generatron is an immersive experience that lets you fill a canvas with shapes, colors and sounds. It's like if a musical launchpad and a drawing canvas had a baby.

At the time, I immediately made Generatron open-source. I wanted to show people people that coding an experience like Generatron wasn't that complicated.

Have fun!

## Running Generatron
### On the Web (Recommended)
Launch https://generatron.cybrneon.xyz to use the experience on the web.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also add Generatron as a Progressive Web App to your iOS, Android, Mac and Windows device.

### Locally
You can also run the experience locally by downloading all the source code to your machine and running a live server.

## Contributing
This project welcomes contributions of all types. Coding features, bug fixes, design, documentation, music production, social media, etc.

We ask that before you start work on a feature that you would like to contribute, please get in touch with @cybrneon and we would be happy to figure out the best approach throughout feature developement.

### Roadmap
**This is what was achived until now**
- Multi-themed visual and audio experience
- Functional UI and better UX.
- Mobile version.
- Web App function.

**What's next**
- A community driven sample repository with contributions from artists and designers, where everyone could make sounds and visuals and share them to everyone to try on Generatron.
- A mobile focused UX for better interactions.
- Having a better UI framework instead of plain HTML and CSS.
- Implementing a store for Generatron merch to support the project.
