# Generatron
#### Version 2.0 - "WHISTLER"

## Introduction
When I started this project during a creative coding course in my second year of the Visual Communication Bachelor at [HEAD-Gen√®ve](https://www.hesge.ch/head/), I wanted it to be bigger than what I achieved at that moment.

Exploring [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and diving a bit more in web technologies was really fun. Teachers and people were so enthusiastic to see the project develop and I had big dreams for it.

**The idea of mixing music and live visuals isn't new.** The goal of Generatron is to show people how you could get sucked into a void that you fill with your own predefined shapes and colors that you rythm with premade sounds. It's like if a musical launchpad and a drawing canvas had a baby.

At the time, I immediately made Generatron open-source. I wanted to show people people that coding an experience like Generatron wasn't that complicated.

## Running Generatron
### On the Web
Launch https://generatron.cybrneon.xyz to use the experience on the web.

You can also add Generatron as a Progressive Web App to your iOS, Android, Mac and Windows device.

### Locally
You can also run the experience locally by downloading all the source code to your machine and running a live server.

## Contributing
This project welcomes contributions of all types. Coding features, bug fixes, design, documentation, music production, etc.

We ask that before you start work on a feature that you would like to contribute, please get in touch with @cybrneon and we would be happy to figure out the best approach throughout feature developement.

While working on the project and after your contributions, you are considered a member of the GENERATRON Community.

### Roadmap
This is what was achived until now:
- Multi-themed

### The GENERATRON Community
Open-source is the driving force for Generatron, and this is why it is so important to have a comunity driving this project.
