# Generatron
#### Version 2 - "WHISTLER"
#### [generatron.cybrneon.xyz](https://generatron.cybrneon.xyz/)

## 🗣️ Introduction
When I started this project during a creative coding course in my second year of the Visual Communication Bachelor at [HEAD-Genève](https://www.hesge.ch/head/), I wanted it to be bigger than what I achieved at that moment; a simple school creative coding project.

Exploring [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and diving a bit more in web technologies was really fun. Teachers and people were so enthusiastic to see the project develop and I had big dreams for it.

**The idea of mixing music and live visuals isn't new.**, but Generatron is another kind of immersive experience that lets you fill a virtual canvas with 3D shapes, colors and sounds. It's like if a musical launchpad and a drawing canvas had a baby.

At the time, I immediately made Generatron open-source. I wanted to show people that coding an experience like Generatron wasn't that complicated.

Have fun! :D

### 🎟️ Themes
Currently, there are 5 themes that you can play with in Generatron 2:
- Synthwave (the original sample of the early alpha remastered)
- Retrowave (from [*Another Resonnance*](https://youtu.be/8_Ccd9WUqMU?si=oUBIkVlTQY1_RxJf))
- Future Funk
- House
- Ambiant

All of the sounds were made in-house, under the [KYBRNEON](https://open.spotify.com/artist/48nqLcH2xb1ufAYrkBlTwk?si=m82mOcQyTs222c-1zkKndg) alias.
**Generatron is open to collaborating with artists and designers.**

- Web App function.

**What's next**
- A community driven sample repository with contributions from artists and designers, where everyone could make sounds and visuals and share them to everyone to try on Generatron.
- A better mobile UX for intuitive interactions.
- Having a better UI framework instead of plain HTML and CSS.
- A sound AND video recorder of the canvas, with export options for different aspect ratios.
